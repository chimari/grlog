### Introduction ###
GAOES-RV / Seimei Telescope Observation Log Eeditor (grlog) is a program
to show /edit /mail observation logs of GAOES-RV of 3.8-m Seimei Telescope,
Kyoto University.

 You can make a clone of the latest version of its source code
via Git Hub, using
  git clone https://github.com/chimari/grlog.git
in your terminal.


### Environment ###
This program is running under UNIX OSs with X window systems.
Gtk+3 (recommended) is required.
You need to use mutt with msmtp to send logs via e-mail 
(only for the summit system).

xdotool, xgterm and IRAF environment for HDS data reduction (hdsql etc.) 
are required to be installed to the system, if you want to use quick 
reduction buttons.


### How to Make (for UNIX, Linux & Solaris) ###
  - Extract archives, go to the extracted directory.

  - (Only if you cloned the source code via GitHub)
    % touch configure configure.ac aclocal.m4 Makefile.am Makefile.in

  - for Gtk+3
      % ./configure  --with-gtk3

  - % make

Then, an executable file "hdslog" should be built.
You can copy this file to other directory as you like.

## How to Run
  % grlog [-s shared_dir] [-w work_dir] [-l login.cl_dir] [-h] [-u] data_dir
  -u : Automatic Update for comming frames
  -p : Push mode for comment update to Seimei Exposure Log
  -d : Debug mode w/ Network logging

  -s shared_dir   : dir. where ref frames and QL pys are located
                                 (def.: HOME$/IRAF/GAOES-RV_ql/)
  -w work_dir     : working dir. for QL (def.: <data_dir>/ql/)
  -l login.cl_dir : dir. where login.cl is located (def.: HOME$/)
     data_dir     : dir. where RAW data (GRA????????.fits) are located


## Lock File
   /tmp/grlog-yyyymmdd.lock
  will be created during directory scanning.
   /tmp/.lock_grql.<username>
  will be created when the quick reduction process (pyraf) is running.


## Log Note File
   HOME$Log/.grlog-yyyymmdd
  will be created.
  This file remains even after the program finished.


## Mail address list
  Mail addresses are automatically stocked in
   HOME$/.hdslog_mail.lst
  The list is automatically loaded as mail address book when you send
  a log to observers.
